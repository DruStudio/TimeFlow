### Updates Needed
- Update all 10 existing visualization pages with new cosmic color scheme
- Replace old earth-tone colors with vibrant logo colors
- Update gradients and effects

## 🎯 CURRENT STATE

**What Works NOW:**
- Homepage loads with logo and vibrant design
- 2 visualization pages work perfectly (year-progress, day-grid)
- Color scheme matches logo throughout
- Animations and effects working
- Responsive design functional

**What Needs Work:**
- 10 existing pages have old color scheme (earth tones instead of cosmic)
- 8 new visualization concepts need to be built
- All pages need logo in navigation

## 📝 QUICK FIX

To make existing pages match the new theme, you need to:
1. Update colors in each HTML file
2. Change accent colors from #d4a574 to #ff8c42
3. Add logo to navigation
4. Update gradients to use cosmic colors

Or I can create all 12 pages from scratch with the new theme!

## 🚀 RECOMMENDATION

**Option A:** I create all 12 brand new pages with cosmic theme (BEST)
**Option B:** I update the 10 existing pages + create 2 new ones
**Option C:** You use what's done now and gradually build the rest

Which would you like me to do?
