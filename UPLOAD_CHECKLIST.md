## 🚀 Quick Upload Steps

1. **Create Repository**
   - Go to github.com/new
   - Name: `time-flow`
   - Privacy: **Private** (recommended to prevent copying)
   - Don't add README, .gitignore, or license (we have our own)

2. **Upload Files**
   - Click "uploading an existing file"
   - Drag entire `time-flow` folder contents
   - Or use the ZIP file: `time-flow-github.zip`

3. **Enable GitHub Pages** (Optional - for free hosting)
   - Settings → Pages
   - Source: main branch
   - Folder: / (root)
   - Save

4. **Test**
   - Visit: `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/time-flow/`
   - Or clone and run locally: `python3 -m http.server 8000`

## ⚠️ Remember

- **NEVER open index.html directly** - use a server!
- Make repository **Private** to protect your code
- Add topics: `javascript`, `visualization`, `time`, `mindfulness`

## ✨ You're Done!

Your site is now on GitHub and ready to deploy anywhere.
